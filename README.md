# MATRIX-dashboards
An inventory of dashboard development for One Health disease surveillance. Produced within Work Package 6 of the [One Health EJP](https://onehealthejp.eu/) project [MATRIX](https://onehealthejp.eu/jip-matrix/).

## Structure
This repository is divided into two main sections: A dashboard information hub (kept in the **docs** folder), and working dashboard examples to complement the information (kept in the **code** folder).

### Information hub
This is the starting point of the inventory. The idea is that someone who wants to develop a surveillance dashboard can go to this information hub (publicly accessible as a webpage at https://sva-se.github.io/MATRIX-dashboards) and learn which approach sutits their partciular project best. It will contain suggestions depending on a project's particular needs in terms of, for example:

- Workflow
  - Source of data
  - Input/output
  - Frequency of updates
- Suitable technologies/platforms
- Type of content
- Security/access requirements

The information hub will be edited using the **markdown** (MD) language (see the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for a good tutorial). Each page of the hub will be its own MD file in the **docs** directory of this repository. These files can be edited directly in the browser here at GitHub, but you can also sync the repository to your PC using git, work locally and then push the changes when ready. For a tutorial on git, see the [Git handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

### Dashboard examples
To examplify different approaches, we will also put up working dashboard examples (or links to such) in this repository. These can either be "real" dashboards that we have produced, or dummy examples with fake data just to give an idea of what the result can look like. Each example should live inside its own subfolder in the **code** directory, and should be referenced in a suitable place inside the information hub. To work on these dashboard examples, you need to sync the repo locally using git.
